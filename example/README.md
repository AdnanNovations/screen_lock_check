# screen_lock_check_example

Demonstrates how to use the screen_lock_check plugin.

## Getting Started

Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies, and then `flutter run` to run the example app.

The example app only captures the state of the device at the time of build. If you change the lockscreen preferences while the app is running and want to see an updated view, you will need to rebuild the app, or extend the example app to listen for app lifecycle changes.
